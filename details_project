Now that you've got a bit more comfortable with JavaScript, let's practice some filtering. In this challenge, you'll need to filter the job listings by the categories selected. There are two options to choose from for how to approach it:

Option 1: Filter job listings based on the categories using the HTML data- attribute. In this option, you'd use the hardcoded content that already exists in the index.html file.
Option 2: Use the local data.json file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content. This would be perfect if you're looking to practice a JS library/framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.
Brief
Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Filter job listings based on the categories selected
Learning Outcomes
You'll learn how to use JavaScript to filter items in the DOM. This is a key skill when building client-side applications, so this challenge will be great practice!
